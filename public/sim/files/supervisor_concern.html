      <p>Hi Marcus,</p>
      <p>
        I wanted to take a moment to reach out regarding some concerns I’ve observed 
        over the past two weeks. During shift reviews and team meetings, it seems 
        you’ve been more distracted than usual. Several action items have been left 
        incomplete or delayed, and there were instances where important safety checks 
        were overlooked.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know you’re capable of strong work — you’ve demonstrated this before. 
        However, attentiveness on the floor is critical, not only for production 
        targets but also for ensuring the safety of yourself and the team. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If there’s something impacting your ability to focus, please let me know. 
        We can discuss support options, whether it’s adjusting workloads, scheduling 
        changes, or additional resources. I’d like to see improvement by next week’s 
        review, but I also want to make sure you have the help you need.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s schedule a quick check-in tomorrow to talk this through.
      </p>
